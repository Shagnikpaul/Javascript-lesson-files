# My Basics of Javascript lesson files.

## \*Ô∏è‚É£ About

This repository contains a well organized and a numbered collection of Javascript basic concepts that I'm making currently as I am learning Javascript for Web Developement stuff. This repo can be useful for those who want to revise their Javascript concepts.

> Repository is still not complete. New stuff will be added soon in the future.

> Some stuff might be missing in the Lesson files since I might have skipped them.

## üîß Repo Structure.

This repo contains two main folders -

- `Lessons` - This has the Javascript concepts from beginner to Intermediate. Each topic has a `script.js` and `index.html` file.

- `Practice` - Contains miscellaneous small simple projects made using vanilla JS.

## üò≥ Contributions are welcomed.

I have just started learning Web Dev and other stuff so my code or my approach to a paticular problem might not be perfect or correct. So any corrections or new additions are always welcomed. Your contributions can make my repo even better and I can learn new stuff from my mistakes. ü§ì
